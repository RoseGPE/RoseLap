Modeling
- "Two-track" model like ETH could be a good foray into vehicle dynamics beyond a point mass
- Shifting times can be implimented readily
- Modeling launch properly - assume impending wheel slip

Tracks
- Complex track setups - skid pad, accel, autocross are not closed tracks
- Ellipses and splines, etc.

Analysis (Studies)
- 3D studies
- Not sure if varying engine curves is doable yet?
