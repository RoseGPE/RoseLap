Modeling
- "Two-track" model like ETH could be a good foray into vehicle dynamics beyond a point mass
- Shifting times can be implimented readily
- There (might? should?) be a bug wherein accelerating during turns isn't allowing maximum vehicle speed
- Modeling launch properly - assume impending wheel slip

Tracks
- Complex track setups - skid pad, accel, autocross are not closed tracks
- Ellipses and splines, etc.

Analysis
- Plots right now kinda suck, as do studies
- Setting up batch studies needs to be done, not sure of best way
	- Multi-dimensional studies
