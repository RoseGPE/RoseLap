#### TRACK SETUP ####

# List of tracks to load
track:
- ne_autocross_2015.dxf
- ne_endurance_2015.dxf
# Segment size to use on each track (0.2 is a pretty good size)
segment_distance:
- 0.2
- 0.2
# Whether or not to use 'steady state' solving (slows down simulation)
steady_state:
- false
- false
# What type of event each track is (for point formulation)
point_formulas:
- autocross
- endurance_noeff # you can use endurance_noeff to disable efficiency scoring
# Top times on each track (just need a ballpark, really. Point formulas are non-linear technically but they're pretty close to it)
min_times:
- 57.51
- 90.24
# CO2 usage, for computing efficiency score in the endurance event. Don't need to give a value if you aren't using it.
min_co2:
- None
- 0.3594

# Tests. This is a 3D setup. To do a 2D setup, simply omit tests2.

# what outputs do you want? There is laptime, lateral acceleration (at end of track; included for correlation study), and competition points.
plot_outputs:
- time
- points

# plotting parameters
plot_style: basic
plot_title: Brake Bias Study (Lincoln)
plot_x_label: Brake Bias (0 is actually dynamic biasing)
plot_y_label: YAXIS
#plot_points: Null # if you specify this it must be as big as there are test values.
